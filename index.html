        <h3><strong>Aim & Scope of Journal.</strong></h3><br/> 
         
              <p style="text-align: justify">The goal of the peer-reviewed publication JIEET is to publish and disseminate original research articles on the most recent advancements in all areas of engineering science and technology. The journal publishes original studies that advance engineering technology and instruction while also helping us understand engineering science. The articles may be experimental, theoretical (including computational), or both. The submission must have never been published before and should not be in the works for another publication. Standard double-blind peer review is still used by JIEET. Due to the double-blind approach, neither the author nor the reviewer are aware of the other's identity. JIEET is an open access publication, thus readers and their institutions are not charged to access the journal's contents. Under the condition that they are properly acknowledged and cited, open access supports users' rights to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the complete texts of these articles. JIEET releases one issue annually. The JIEET publication fees cover the paper acceptance, peer review, editing, publication, and uploading to the JIEET website .A maximum of 8-12 pages should be included in each paper. There is no publication charges to publish in this journal. </p>

              <h4 style="color:black">Submission</h4>
              <p>
                Manuscripts should be submitted by one of the authors of the manuscript through the manuscript submission system for our journal. Only electronic PDF (.pdf) or Word (.doc, .docx, .odt, .rtf, .txt) files can be submitted through the manuscript submission system, and there is no page limit. Special characters should not be included in the file name of the main manuscript file. Submissions by anyone other than one of the authors will not be accepted. The submitting author takes responsibility for the manuscript during submission and peer review.
              </p>
              <h4 style="color:black">Terms of submission</h4>
              <p>Manuscripts must be submitted on the understanding that they have not been published elsewhere and are only being considered by this journal. The submitting author is responsible for ensuring that the article’s publication has been approved by all the other coauthors. It is also the submitting author’s responsibility to ensure that the article has all necessary institutional approvals. Only an acknowledgment from the editorial office officially establishes the date of receipt. Further correspondence and proofs will be sent to the author(s) before publication, unless otherwise indicated. It is a condition of submission that the authors permit editing of the manuscript for readability. </p>
              <h4 style="color:black">Peer review</h4>
              <p> All submitted articles are subject to assessment and peer review to ensure editorial appropriateness and technical correctness. Research published in the journal must be:</p>
              <br/> 
              <ul style="list-style-type:square;"><li>Scientifically valid – adhering to accepted community standards of research.</li>
                <li>Technically accurate in its methods and results.</li>
                <li>Representative of a specific advance, or replication, or null/negative result, which is worthy of publication.</li>
                <li>As reproducible as possible – sharing underlying data, code, and supporting materials wherever able.</li>
                <li>Ethically sound and transparent – adhering to best practice with respect to animal and human studies, consent to publish, and clear declaration of potential conflicts of interests, both real and perceived.</li>
              </ul>
                <br/>
                <p>In the spirit of sharing findings through our open science mission, emphasis is not placed on novelty, interest, or perceived impact. Replication studies, particularly of research published in this journal, are encouraged.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>In order for an article to be accepted for publication, the assigned editor will first consider if the manuscript meets the minimum editorial standards and fits within the scope of the journal. If an article is considered suitable for the journal, the editor will ideally solicit at least two external peer reviewers (who will remain anonymous to the authors unless they choose to disclose their identity by signing the review report) to assess the article before confirming a decision to accept. Decisions to reject are at the discretion of the editor.</p>
                 <br/>
                <p>Our research integrity team will occasionally seek advice outside standard peer review, for example, on submissions with serious ethical, security, biosecurity, or societal implications. We may consult experts and the editor before deciding on appropriate actions, including but not limited to:</p> 
                <br/>
                <ul style="list-style-type:square;"><li>Recruiting reviewers with specific expertise.</li>
                <li>Assessment by additional editors.</li>
                <li>Declining to further consider a submission.</li>
              </ul>
              <br/>
              <h4 style="color:black">Concurrent submissions</h4>
                <p>In order to ensure sufficient diversity within the authorship of the journal, authors will be limited to having three manuscripts under review at any point in time. If an author already has three manuscripts under review in the journal, they will need to wait until the review process of at least one of these manuscripts is complete before submitting another manuscript for consideration. This policy does not apply to editorials or other non-peer-reviewed manuscript types.</p>
                <h4 style="color:black"> Article processing charges</h4>
                <p>The journal is open access. Article processing charges (APCs) allow the publisher to make articles immediately available online to anyone to read and reuse upon publication.</p>
                <h4 style="color:black">Preprints</h4>
                <p>JIEET supports the deposition of manuscripts in preprint servers, and does not consider this to compromise the novelty of the results. Articles based on content previously made public only on a preprint server, institutional repository, or in a thesis will be considered. The preprint should be cited.</p>
                <h4 style="color:black">Preregistration of studies</h4>
                <p>Authors are encouraged to indicate whether the conducted research was preregistered in an independent, institutional registry. Preregistration of studies involves registering the study design, variables, and treatment conditions prior to conducting the research which includes</p>

                </ul>

                <h4 style="color:black">Preregistration of analysis plans</h4>
                <p>Authors are encouraged to indicate whether or not the conducted research was preregistered with an analysis plan in an independent, institutional registry Preregistration of studies involves registering the study design, variables, and treatment conditions. Including an analysis plan involves specification of sequence of analyses or the statistical model that will be reported.</p>
                <h4 style="color:black">ORCID</h4>
                <p>Prior to publication, an ORCID iD must be provided for the corresponding author(s). If you already have an ORCID iD, you will be asked to provide it. If you haven’t registered with ORCID yet, we’ll help you create an iD at the point of submission. The ORCID is not required for submission, or for peer review, but we will not be able to publish your article online until an ORCID iD is provided.</p>
                <h4 style="color:black">Article types</h4>
                <p>The journal will consider the following article types:</p>
                <h4 style="color:black">Research articles</h4>
                <p>Research articles should present the results of an original research study. These manuscripts should describe how the research project was conducted and provide a thorough analysis of the results of the project. Systematic reviews may be submitted as research articles.</p>
                <h4 style="color:black">Reviews</h4>
                <p>A review article provides an overview of the published literature in a particular subject area.</p>
                <h4 style="color:black">Formatting</h4>
                <p>An optional research article manuscript template can be downloaded from this page. We recommend that all manuscripts include line numbers and follow the structure below:</p>
                <h5 style="color:black">Title and authorship information</h5>
                <p>The following information should be included:</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type:square;"><li>Manuscript title</li>
                <li>Full author names</li>
                <li>Full institutional mailing addresses</li>
                <li>Email addresses</li>
                <li>Affiliations</li></ul>
                <h4 style="color:black">Abstract</h4>
                The manuscript should contain an abstract. The abstract should be self-contained, citation-free, and should not exceed 300 words.
                <h4 style="color:black">Introduction</h4>
                This section should be succinct, with no subheadings.
                <h4 style="color:black">Materials and methods</h4>
                The methods section should provide enough detail for others to be able to replicate the study. If you have more than one method, use subsections with relevant headings, e.g. different models, in vitro and in vivo studies, statistics, materials and reagents, etc.
                <br/>JIEET have no space restriction on methods. Detailed descriptions of the methods (including protocols or project descriptions) and algorithms may also be uploaded as supplementary information or a previous publication that gives more details may be cited. If the method from a previous article is used, then this article must be cited and discussed. If wording is reused from a published article, then this must be noted, e.g. This study uses the method of Smith et al. and the methods description partly reproduces their wording [1].
                <br/>If a method or tool is introduced in the study, including software, questionnaires, and scales, the license this is available under and any requirement for permission for use should be stated. If an existing method or tool is used in the research, the authors are responsible for checking the license and obtaining any necessary permission. If permission was required, a statement confirming permission was granted should be included in the materials and methods section.
                <h4 style="color:black">Publishing protocols</h4> 
                We encourage authors describing any methodology, in particular laboratory-based experiments in the computational and informatics protocols. This is an open access website that allows researchers to record their methods in a structured way, obtain a DOI to allow easy citation of the protocol, collaborate with selected colleagues, share their protocol privately for journal peer review, and choose to make it publicly available. Once published, the protocol can be updated and cited in other articles.
                <br/>You can make your protocol public before publication of your article if you choose, which will not harm the peer review process of your article and may allow you to get comments about your methods to adapt or improve them before you submit your article.
                <h4 style="color:black">Results and discussion</h4>
                This section may be divided into subsections or may be combined.
                <h4 style="color:black">Main text (review only)</h4>
                This section may be divided into subsections or may be combined.
                <h4 style="color:black">Conclusions</h4>
                This should clearly explain the main conclusions of the article, highlighting its importance and relevance.
                <h4 style="color:black">Data availability</h4>
                This statement should describe how readers can access the data supporting the conclusions of the study and clearly outline the reasons why unavailable data cannot be released.
                <h4 style="color:black">Conflicts of interest</h4>
                Authors must declare all relevant interests that could be perceived as conflicting. Authors should explain why each interest may represent a conflict. If no conflicts exist, the authors should state this. Submitting authors are responsible for coauthors declaring their interests.
                <br/>Conflicts of interest (COIs, also known as ‘competing interests’) occur when issues outside research could be reasonably perceived to affect the neutrality or objectivity of the work or its assessment. Authors must declare all potential interests – whether or not they actually had an influence – in the conflicts of interest section, which should explain why the interest may be a conflict. If there are none, the authors should state: “The author(s) declare(s) that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this article”. Submitting authors are responsible for coauthors declaring their interests. Declared conflicts of interest will be considered by the editor and reviewers, and included in the published article.
                <br/>Authors must declare current or recent funding (including for article processing charges) and other payments, goods or services that might influence the work. All funding, whether a conflict or not, must be declared in the funding statement. The involvement of anyone other than the authors who: 
                <ol>
                <li>has an interest in the outcome of the work;</li> 
                <li>is affiliated to an organization with such an interest; or</li> 
                <li>was employed or paid by a funder, in the commissioning, conception, planning, design, conduct, or analysis of the work, the preparation or editing of the manuscript, or the decision to publish must be declared.</li>
              </ol>
                You may be asked to make certain changes to your manuscript as a result of your declaration. These requests are not an accusation of impropriety. The editor or reviewer is helping you to protect your work against potential criticisms.
                <br/>If you are in any doubt about declaring a potential conflict, remember that if it is revealed later – especially after publication – it could cause more problems than simply declaring it at the time of submission. Undeclared conflicts of interest could lead to a corrigendum or, in the most serious cases, a retraction.
                <h4 style="color:black">Acknowledgments</h4>
                All acknowledgments (if any) should be included at the very end of the manuscript before the references. Anyone who made a contribution to the research or manuscript, but who is not a listed author, should be acknowledged (with their permission).
                <h4 style="color:black">References</h4>
                Authors may submit their references in any style. If accepted, these will be reformatted in Chicago style by Hindawi. Authors are responsible for ensuring that the information in each reference is complete and accurate. All references should be numbered consecutively in the order of their first citation. Citations of references in the text should be identified using numbers in square brackets e.g., “as discussed by Smith [9]”; “as discussed elsewhere [9, 10]”. All references should be cited within the text and uncited references will be removed.
                <h4 style="color:black">Citation standards. </h4>
                All data, program code, and other methods should be appropriately cited. Such materials should be recognized as original intellectual contributions and afforded recognition through citation.
                <h4 style="color:black">Date formatting</h4>
                JIEET recommends writing dates out fully to avoid confusion with different all-numeral date styles. For example, 11/10/2018 could be 10 November 2018 or 11 October 2018 depending on the reader, therefore, the date should be written out in full. For example, the date September 1, 2018 should be used rather than 01/09/2018 or 09/01/2018.
                <h4 style="color:black">Units of measurement</h4>
                Units of measurement should be presented simply and concisely using the International System of Units (SI).
                <h4 style="color:black">Preparation of figures</h4>
                Upon submission of an article, authors should include all figures and tables in the PDF file of the manuscript. Figures and tables should not be submitted in separate files. If the article is accepted, authors will be asked to provide the source files of the figures. Each figure should be supplied in a separate electronic file. All figures should be cited in the manuscript in a consecutive order. Figures should be supplied in either vector art formats (Illustrator, EPS, WMF, FreeHand, CorelDraw, PowerPoint, Excel, etc.) or bitmap formats (Photoshop, TIFF, GIF, JPEG, etc.). Bitmap images should be of 300 dpi resolution at least unless the resolution is intentionally set to a lower level for scientific reasons. If a bitmap image has labels, the image and labels should be embedded in separate layers.
                <h4 style="color:black">Preparation of tables</h4>
                Tables should be cited consecutively in the text. Every table must have a descriptive title and if numerical measurements are given, the units should be included in the column heading. Vertical rules should not be used.
                <h4 style="color:black">Supplementary materials</h4>
                Supplementary materials are the additional parts to a manuscript, such as audio files, video clips, or datasets that might be of interest to readers. Authors can submit one file of supplementary material along with their manuscript through the manuscript submission system. If there is more than one file, they can be uploaded as a .ZIP file.
                <br/>A section titled supplementary material should be included before the references list with a concise description for each supplementary material file. Supplementary materials are not modified by our production team. Authors are responsible for providing the final supplementary material files that will be published along with the article.
                <h4 style="color:black">Proofs</h4>
                Corrected proofs must be returned to the publisher within two to three days of receipt. The publisher will do everything possible to ensure prompt publication.
                <h4 style="color:black">Copyright and permissions</h4>
                Authors retain the copyright of their manuscripts, and all open access articles are distributed under the terms of the publisher, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided that the original work is properly cited.
                The use of general descriptive names, trade names, trademarks, and so forth in this publication, even if not specifically identified, does not imply that these names are not protected by the relevant laws and regulations. The submitting author is responsible for securing any permissions needed for the reuse of copyrighted materials included in the manuscript.
                While the advice and information in this journal are believed to be true and accurate on the date of its going to press, neither the authors, the editors, nor the publisher can accept any legal responsibility for any errors or omissions that may be made. The publisher makes no warranty, express or implied, with respect to the material contained herein.
                <h4 style="color:black">Reporting guidelines</h4>
                Authors are strongly encouraged to use appropriate reporting guidelines when preparing and submitting manuscripts, to maximize transparency and reproducibility. Our editors and reviewers are also encouraged to use them in the review process. Completed checklists should be provided in the supplementary files on submission. We particularly encourage the use of:
                •	CONSORT for randomized controlled trials
                •	TREND for non-randomized trials
                •	PRISMA for systematic review and meta-analyses
                •	CARE for case reports
                •	STROBE for observational studies
                •	STREGA for genetic association studies
                •	SRQR for qualitative studies
                •	STARD for diagnostic accuracy studies
                •	ARRIVE for animal experiments
                <h4 style="color:black">Ethical guidelines</h4>
                In any studies on human or animal subjects, the following ethical guidelines must be observed. Manuscripts describing experimental work that carries a risk of harm to human subjects must include a statement that the experiment was conducted with the human subjects’ understanding and consent, as well as a statement that the responsible ethics committee has approved the experiments. In the case of any animal experiments, the authors must provide a full description of any anesthetic or surgical procedure used, as well as evidence that all possible steps were taken to avoid animal suffering at each stage of the experiment.
                <h4 style="color:black">Appeals</h4>
                Authors may appeal if they feel that the decision to reject was based on: 
                •	a major misunderstanding over a technical aspect of the manuscript; or 
                •	a failure to understand the scientific advance shown by the manuscript. Appeals requesting a second opinion without sufficient justification will not be considered. To lodge an appeal, please contact the journal by email, quoting your manuscript number. Appeals will only be considered from the original submitting author.

              <h3>Reviewer Guidelines</h3>
              <p style="text-align: justify"><p><strong><em>Applications to review</em></strong></p>
              <p>We appreciate applications to join our community of peer reviewers.</p>
              <p>Please apply below if you wish to&nbsp;become a reviewer for JIEET journal.<br /> <br /> You may also be contacted with requests to review for other journals in your subject area.</p>
              <p>Please note that completion of this form does not guarantee that you will be contacted to review. Our Academic Editors select reviewers on a manuscript-by-manuscript basis. In each case, the most relevant scientists will be invited.</p>
              <p><strong>How to peer review for JIEET</strong></p>
              <p>The reviewer report should comprehensively critique the submission and consist of much more than a few brief sentences. JIEET does not require a specific structure for reports, however, a suggested format is:</p>
              <ul style="list-style: circle;">
              <li>Summary</li>
              <li>Major issues</li>
              <li>Minor issues</li>
              </ul>
              <p>We encourage reviewers to help authors improve their manuscript. The report should give constructive analysis to authors, particularly where revisions are recommended. Where reviewers do not wish authors to see certain comments, these can be added to the confidential comments to the Academic Editor.</p>
              <p>While expectations vary by discipline, some core aspects that should be critiqued by reviewers may include:</p>
              <ul style="list-style: circle;">
              <li>Are the research questions valid?</li>
              <li>Is the sample size sufficient?</li>
              <li>Is there necessary ethical approval and/or consent and was the research ethical?</li>
              <li>Are the methods and study design appropriate for answering the research question?</li>
              <li>Do the experiments have appropriate controls?</li>
              <li>Is the reporting of the methods, including any equipment and materials, sufficiently detailed that the research might be reproduced?</li>
              <li>Are any statistical tests used appropriate and correctly reported?</li>
              <li>Are the figures and tables clear and do they accurately represent the results?</li>
              <li>Has previous research by the authors and others been discussed and have those results been compared to the current results?</li>
              <li>Are there any inappropriate citations, for example, not supporting the claim being made or too many citations to the authors' own articles?</li>
              <li>Do the results support the conclusions?</li>
              <li>Are limitations of the research acknowledged?</li>
              <li>Is the abstract an accurate summary of the research and results, without spin?</li>
              <li>Is the language clear and understandable?</li>
              </ul>
              <p>To help authors receive timely reviews, reviewer reports should be submitted via the manuscript tracking system on or before the agreed deadline. Reviewers should contact JIEET if they are unable to meet the deadline so an alternative date can be arranged.</p>
              <p>We encourage reviewers to focus their reports on objectively critiquing the scientific aspects of the submission, including the soundness of the methodology and whether the conclusions can be supported by the results. At the end of their review, we ask reviewers to recommend one of the following actions:</p>
              <ul style="list-style: circle;">
              <li>Publish Unaltered</li>
              <li>Consider after Minor Changes</li>
              <li>Consider after Major Changes</li>
              <li>Reject</li>
              </ul>
              <p>However, it is important to note that the overall decision will be made by the Academic Editor.</p>
              <p><strong><em>Confidentiality</em></strong></p>
              <p>Manuscripts under peer review should be strictly confidential. Reviewers must not share manuscripts or discuss their content with anyone outside the peer review process.</p>
              <p>Reviewers may, on request, consult with colleagues from their research group trusting that the confidentiality of the manuscript is maintained. Reviewers should first contact JIEETor the Academic Editor handling the manuscript and note the name of the colleague(s) in the &lsquo;Comments to the editor&rsquo; section of their report.</p>
              <p>Reviewers will be anonymous to the authors unless they choose to disclose their identity by signing the review report.</p>
              <p><strong><em>Conflicts of interest</em></strong></p>
              <p>Reviewers should decline to review a submission when they:</p>
              <ul style="list-style: circle;">
              <li>Have a recent publication or current submission with any author</li>
              <li>Share or have recently shared an affiliation with any author</li>
              <li>Collaborate or have recently collaborated with any author</li>
              <li>Have a close personal connection to any author</li>
              <li>Have a financial interest in the subject of the work</li>
              <li>Feel unable to be objective</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Reviewers must declare any remaining interests in the &lsquo;Confidential&rsquo; section of the review form, which will be considered by the editor.</p>
              <p>Reviewers must declare if they have previously discussed the manuscript with the authors.</p>
              <p>Reviewers are encouraged to comment on authors&rsquo; declared conflicts of interest. If there are concerns that authors have not fully disclosed financial, institutional, commercial, personal, ideological, or academic interests, this should be raised in the reviewer report.</p></p>

              <h3>Publication Ethics</h3>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">           
                Ethical standards for publication exist to ensure high-quality scientific publications, public trust
                in scientific findings, and that people receive credit for their work and ideas. JIEET aims to
                adhere to its guidelines and core practices.</p>
                
               <h4 style="color:black"> Article assessment</h4>
                
               <p style="text-align: justify;">  All manuscripts are subject to peer review and are expected to meet standards of academic
                excellence. If approved by the editor, submissions will be considered by peer reviewers, whose
                identities will remain anonymous to the authors.</p>
                <br/>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">   Our Research Integrity team will occasionally seek advice outside standard peer review, for
                example, on submissions with serious ethical, security, biosecurity, or societal implications. We
                may consult experts and the academic editor before deciding on appropriate actions, including
                but not limited to recruiting reviewers with specific expertise, assessment by additional editors,
                and declining to further consider a submission.</p>
               
                <h4 style="color:black">Plagiarism</h4>
                
                <p style="text-align: justify;">  Authors must not use the words, figures, or ideas of others without attribution. All sources must
                be cited at the point they are used, and reuse of wording must be limited a
                attributed or quoted in the text. </p>
                <br/>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">  JIEET uses Crossref Similarity Check (iThenticate) to detect submissions that overlap with
                published and submitted manuscripts.</p>
                <br/>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">  Manuscripts that are found to have been plagiarized from a manuscript by other authors, whether
                published or unpublished, will be rejected and the authors may incur sanctions. Any published
                articles may need to be corrected or retracted.</p>
                <h4 style="color:black">Duplicate submission and redundant publication</h4>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">  JIEET journals consider only original content, i.e. articles that have not been previously
                published, including in a language other than English. Articles based on content previously made
                public only on a preprint server, institutional repository, or in a thesis will be considered.
                <br/>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Manuscripts submitted to this journals must not be submitted elsewhere while under
                consideration and must be withdrawn before being submitted elsewhere. Authors whose articles
                are found to have been simultaneously submitted elsewhere may incur sanctions.</p>
                <br/>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">  If authors have used their own previously published work, or work that is currently under review,
                as the basis for a submitted manuscript, they must cite the previous articles and indicate how
                their submitted manuscript differs from their previous work. Reuse of the authors' own words
                outside the Methods should be attributed or quoted in the text. Reuse of the authors' own figures
                or substantial amounts of wording may require permission from the copyright holder and the authors are responsible for obtaining this.
                <br/><br/>
                JIEET journal will consider extended versions of articles published at conferences provided this is declared in the cover letter, the previous version is clearly cited and discussed, there is significant new content, and any necessary permissions are obtained.
                <br/><br/>
                Redundant publication, the inappropriate division of study outcomes into more than one article (also known as salami slicing), may result in rejection or a request to merge submitted manuscripts, and the correction of published articles. Duplicate publication of the same, or a very similar, article may result in the retraction of the later article and the authors may incur sanctions.
                <h4 style="color:black">Citation manipulation</h4>
                Authors whose submitted manuscripts are found to include citations whose primary purpose is to increase the number of citations to a given author’s work, or to articles published in a particular journal, may incur sanctions.
                <br/><br/>
                Editors and reviewers must not ask authors to include references merely to increase citations to their own or an associate’s work, to the journal, or to another journal they are associated with.
                <h4 style="color:black">Fabrication and falsification</h4>
                The authors of submitted manuscripts or published articles that are found to have fabricated or falsified the results, including the manipulation of images, may incur sanctions, and published articles may be retracted.
                <h4 style="color:black">Authorship and acknowledgements</h4>
                All listed authors must have made a significant scientific contribution to the research in the manuscript, approved its claims, and agreed to be an author. It is important to list everyone who made a significant scientific contribution. We refer to the ICMJE guidelines. Author contributions may be described at the end of the submission, optionally using roles defined by CRediT. Submitting authors must provide an ORCID and we encourage all authors to provide one. Changes in authorship must be declared to the journal and agreed to by all authors. An author may change their name on a published article.
                <ul style="list-style: circle;"><li>Anyone who contributed to the research or manuscript preparation, but is not an author, should be acknowledged with their permission.</li>
                <li>Submissions by anyone other than one of the authors will not be considered.</li>
              </ul>
                <h4 style="color:black">Conflicts of interest</h4>
                Conflicts of interest (COIs, also known as ‘competing interests’) occur when issues outside research could be reasonably perceived to affect the neutrality or objectivity of the work or its assessment. This can happen at any stage in the research cycle, including during the experimentation phase, while a manuscript is being written, or during the process of turning a manuscript into a published article. 
                <br/><br/>If unsure, declare a potential interest or discuss with the editorial office. Undeclared interests may incur sanctions. Submissions with undeclared conflicts that are later revealed may be rejected. Published articles may need to be re-assessed, have a corrigendum published, or in serious cases be retracted. 
                <br/><br/>Conflicts of interest do not always stop work from being published or prevent someone from being involved in the review process. However, they must be declared. A clear declaration of all possible conflicts – whether they actually had an influence or not – allows others to make informed decisions about the work and its review process.
                <br/><br/>If conflicts of interest are found after publication, this may be embarrassing for the authors, the Editor and the journal. It may be necessary to publish a corrigendum or reassess the review process.
                Conflicts include the following:
                <ul style="list-style: circle;">
                <li>Financial — funding and other payments, goods and services received or expected by the authors relating to the subject of the work or from an organization with an interest in the outcome of the work</li>
                <li>	Affiliations — being employed by, on the advisory board for, or a member of an organization with an interest in the outcome of the work</li>
                <li>	Intellectual property — patents or trademarks owned by someone or their organization</li>
                <li>	Personal — friends, family, relationships, and other close personal connections</li>
                <li>	Ideology — beliefs or activism, for example, political or religious, relevant to the work</li>
                <li>	Academic — competitors or someone whose work is critiqued</li>
                <h4 style="color:black">Authors</h4>
                <br/><br/>Authors must declare all potential interests in a ‘Conflicts of interest’ section, which should explain why the interest may be a conflict. If there are none, the authors should state “The author(s) declare(s) that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.” Submitting authors are responsible for coauthors declaring their interests.
                <br/><br/>Authors must declare current or recent funding (including article processing charges) and other payments, goods or services that might influence the work. All funding, whether a conflict or not, must be declared in the ‘Funding Statement’.
                
                <br/><br/>The involvement of anyone other than the authors who 1) has an interest in the outcome of the work; 2) is affiliated to an organization with such an interest; or 3) was employed or paid by a funder, in the commissioning, conception, planning, design, conduct, or analysis of the work, the preparation or editing of the manuscript, or the decision to publish must be declared.
                <br/><br/>Declared conflicts of interest will be considered by the editor and reviewers and included in the published article.
                <h4 style="color:black">Editors and Reviewers</h4>
                Editors and reviewers should decline to be involved with a submission when they
                <ul style="list-style: circle;">
                  <li>	Have a recent publication or current submission with any author</li>
                  <li>	Share or recently shared an affiliation with any author</li>
                  <li>	Collaborate or recently collaborated with any author</li>
                  <li>	Have a close personal connection to any author</li>
                  <li>	Have a financial interest in the subject of the work</li>
                  <li>	Feel unable to be objective</li>
                </ul>
                Reviewers must declare any remaining interests in the ‘Confidential’ section of the review form, which will be considered by the editor.
                <br/><br/>Editors and reviewers must declare if they have previously discussed the manuscript with the authors.
                <h4 style="color:black">Sanctions</h4>
                If JIEET becomes aware of breaches of our publication ethics policies, whether or not the breach occurred in a journal published by JIEET, the following sanctions may be applied across the JIEET journal:
                <ul style="list-style: circle;">
                <li>	Rejection of the manuscript and any other manuscripts submitted by the author(s).</li>
                <li>Not allowing submission for 1–3 years.</li>
                <li>	Prohibition from acting as an editor or reviewer.</li>
                <li>JIEET may apply additional sanctions for severe ethical violations.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4 style="color:black">Investigations</h4>
                Suspected breaches of our publication ethics policies, either before and after publication, as well as concerns about research ethics, should be reported to our Research Integrity team.
                <br/><br/>
                JIEET may ask the authors to provide the underlying data and images, consult editors, and contact institutions or employers to ask for an investigation or to raise concerns.
                <h4 style="color:black">Corrections and retractions</h4>
                When errors are identified in published articles, the publisher will consider what action is required and may consult the editors and the authors’ institution(s).
                Errors by the authors may be corrected by a corrigendum and errors by the publisher by an erratum.
                If there are errors that significantly affect the conclusions or there is evidence of misconduct, this may require retraction or an expression of concern following the COPE Retraction Guidelines. All authors will be asked to agree to the content of the notice.
                An author name change after publication will be made to the article and any citing articles published by JIEET without requiring documentation, a corrigendum notice, or informing any other authors, following a request to the journal or the Research Integrity team.

              <h3>Peer Review Process</h3>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">
                The following is the editorial workflow that every manuscript submitted to the journal undergoes
                during the course of the peer review process.</p><br/>
                <p style="text-align: justify;"> The entire editorial workflow is performed via the manuscript submission system for our
                journals. Once a manuscript is submitted for publication, the manuscript is checked by the
                journal's editorial office to ensure the files are complete and that the relevant metadata are in
                order. The manuscript is then sent to the Chief Editor who assesses the suitability of the
                manuscript in terms of scope and quality and, if appropriate, assigns it to an Academic Editor.</p><br/>
               <p style="text-align: justify;"> The Academic Editor then performs an additional, more detailed, analysis before inviting a
                number of potential reviewers to provide a peer review report the Academic Editor can reject a
                manuscript prior to review if they deem it unsuitable for the journal. Based on reports submitted
                by the reviewers, the Academic Editor makes one of the following recommendations:</p><br/>
                <ul style="list-style-type:disc;"><li>Reject</li>
                  <li>Major Revision</li>
                  <li>Minor Revision</li>
                  <li>Publish</li></ul><br/>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;">If the Acade Editor recommends "Reject", the authors are sent any review reports that have
                been received and are notified that their manuscript will no longer be considered for publication
                in the journal.</p><br/>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">If the Academic Editor recommends "Major Revision", the authors are notified of the editor's
                request that they prepare and submit an updated version of their manuscript with the necessary
                changes suggested by the reviewers and editor. This might require new data to be collected or
                substantial revision of the text. The manuscript is then reassessed by one or more of the original
                reviewers before the Academic Editor makes a new recommendation.</p><br/>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">If the Academic Editor recommends "Minor Revision", the authors are notified of the editor's
                request that they prepare and submit a revised copy f their manuscript with the required minor
                changes suggested by the reviewers and editor. Once satisfied with the final manuscript,
                optionally having sought further advice from one or more of the reviewers, the Academic Editor
                can recommend "Publish".</p><br/>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">If the Academic Editor recommends "Publish", the manuscript will undergo a final check by the
                journal's Chief Editor and editorial office in order to ensure that the manuscript and its review
                process adhere to the journal's guidelines and policies. The authors will then be notified of the
                manuscript's acceptance.</p><br/>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">The Chief Editor remains ultimately responsible for the aims and scope of the title and will be
                called upon to handle appeals and other editorial issues as and when required.</p>
